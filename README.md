# Hacklytics

## Getting started
You will need to navigate to your terminal/command prompt/anaconda prompt and type in
```
pip install streamlit
```
after installing streamlit you will type in
```
streamlit hello
```
to make sure streamlit installed and is running correctly

If you get any errors you can debug them via stackoverflow, we all got several different bugs so it's a bit wonky.

After getting streamlit running and seeing the default website you can clone the repo and navigate to the Hackalytics directory on your local machine.
When you have gotten into the directory run the code
```
streamlit run app.py
```
and checkout the website we made!
